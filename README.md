# Knowledge Representation and Reasoning

This project includes the implementation in Prolog of several key algorithms of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning, such as:

- Reasoning Algorithm (`reasoning.pl`).
- SAT solver - the Davis Putnam procedure (`sat.pl`).
- Forward and Backward chaining (`fwd_chaining.pl` & `bkw_chaining.pl`).
- Defuzzification (`defuzzification.pl`).

A comprehensive description of the approaches is drawn in files `Documentation_1.pdf` and `Documentation_2.pdf`.
