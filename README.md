# Knowledge Representation and Reasoning

This project includes the implementation in Prolog of several key concepts of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning, such as:

- Reasoning Algorithm.
- SAT solver (the Davis Putnam procedure).
- Forward and Backward chaining.
- Defuzzification.

A comprehensive description of the approaches is drawn in files `Documentation_1.pdf` and `Documentation_2.pdf`.
